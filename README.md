Airbnb rieview identifier

This project involves the following:
The download of Airbnb data from the following website http://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data/,
the data is in the form of csv’s. The code automatically downloads the data and creates a file
to store the data. 

The reviews of the Airbnb’s are then used as an input to an identifier that determines if the
reviews are negative or positive. Due to the computational time required for this task the csv
is updated with an extra field containing the identifiers results for each reviews.
